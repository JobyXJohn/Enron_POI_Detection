    "<pre>1. Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?  [relevant rubric items: “data exploration”, “outlier investigation”]</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a dataset (a dictionary) of people with their names as 'keys' and a bunch of financial and email features. They are also identified as being a Person Of Interest (poi) or not. The goal is to train a supervised machine learning algorithm that can idenitfy whether or not a person ins a poi given the financial and email features alone and provide a *precision* and *recall* of over 0.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "#####Why Machine Learning\n",
    "There are many features (14 financial and 7 email) makes this an intractable problem to just plot figures to figure out clusters or identify trends that separate poi's from non-poi's. The fact that we have labels idetifying the poi's from the non-poi's makes this a problem suited for supervised machine learning. Technically we could also use an unspervised approach (like a k-means with k=2), but such an approach is not appropriate as it would be be tantamount to throwing away information in the case of this particular dataset where we know if a person is a poi or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####Data Exploration:\n",
    "The dictionary has 146 entries. Of these, one is the TOTAL which is addressed below. \n",
    "There are 18 poi's and the rest 127 are non-poi's. As mentioned before we have 14 financial and 7 email features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many of the financial features have more than 50% missing values:\n",
    "    * deferral_payments (73% vamissing values are missing);\n",
    "    * 'loan_advances' (97% missing values)    \n",
    "    * 'restricted_stock_deferred' (85% missing values)\n",
    "    * 'deferred_income' (66% missing values)\n",
    "    * 'long_term_incentive' (54% missing values)\n",
    "    * 'director_fees' (88% missing values)\n",
    "This is indicating that these features would have poor predicitve power and should not be considered.    \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Outliers:\n",
    "To check if there are outliers is an important step if one is performing regression or support vector machine (svm) based classification as the outliers can greatly affect the outcome of the classifier. For a decision tree, for example, this does not impact as much, as the algorithm functions on information-gain based splitting and will not be affected by the distance of one point from the mean of the data. The primary method used for detection of outliers was plotting the data in 2 and 3 dimensions (plot_features.py). It was observed that the TOTAL entry in the dictionary is an outlier and therefore needs to be removed (using data_dict.pop('TOTAL',0))\n",
    "\n",
    "Three other employees are also removed for very high bonuses. LAY KENNETH L, SKILLING JEFFREY K,'FREVERT MARK A'\n",
    "To spot an outlier, once the plot is made, the approximate value of the outlier is estimated and then the dictionary is checked iteratively to find all the keys that meet the condition (i.e. choose keys with feature greater than relevant value.)\n",

Also, the newly introduced features are all ratios and hence by definition are between 0 and 1. It then becomes necessary to use a min-max scaler. Other approaches like DecisionTree and Adaboosted-DecisionTree did not need scaled features. However the scaled features were used in testing these algortihms also. It is important to note that the *fit* of the *scaling* is done on training data and in the tester.py the same scaler is used. See line 26 in tester.py:  \n",

    "3. **'Topoi2frm'** Ratio of mails from a person to the poi to the total number of mails sent.\n",
    "    If the person is sending too many emails to the poi relative to the total emails he sends out, it could imply that they are also a poi. It is necessary to normalize the emails sent out so that we can compare two subjects with completely different email volumes.\n",
    "4. **'frmpoi2To'** Ratio of mail from a poi to a person to the total number of mails received.\n",
    "    Same reason as the above feature. More emails coming in from a poi can indicate the recepient is also a poi. \n",
    "5. **'poi_mail_ratio'** Ratio of total number of mail to and from a poi to the total number of mails to and from a person.\n",
    "    This feature is also designed using the same reason as above. But instead of using the To and From emails separately, here the ratio of all emails to and from a poi to the total emails to and from a person is considered. This is the feature that finally helped meet the performance criterion (0.3 precision and recall).\n",
    "6. **'is_enron_emp'**: weather or not a person is an enron employee\n",
    "    It is observed from the data that all poi's have an *@enron.com* email address. So it is safe to say that if some one is not an enron employee, he is not a poi. The hope was that adding this feature will bring down the number of False Positives and hence bring up the precision.   \n",
